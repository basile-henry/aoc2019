# Advent of Code 2019

In this edition of the Advent of Code, I am attempting the puzzles in OCaml.
The solutions may not be pretty, or idiomatic but this is mostly for me to learn
how the language works and the tooling around it.

# Build and run

This project uses `dune` to build the code. To build and run a specific
solution:

```sh
dune exec ./main.exe <day> <part>
```

So for day 1 and part 1:

```sh
dune exec ./main.exe 1 1
```
